Tools for Scraping Time/Distances from province to province/district to district travel in Peru
====================

**Programmer:** Marco Gutierrez

This repo contains several tools so scrape data on travel time and distances in Peru. It was created as part of a major project that will use this data as an input for a Covid SIR model.

Some of the tools you can find here are the following:

1. Jupyter notebook with a WazeRoute based Scraper (for Times and Distances)
1. Jupyter notebook with a Google DistanceMatrix based Scraper (for Times and Distances)
1. Reverse Geocoder for antennas locations
1. Province/District to Ubigeo (Peruvian location id) converter

I've also attached some of the input/output data from the mentioned scripts:

1. Time and Distances for traveling from province to province
1. Provinces/District Ubigeos
1. INEI Original Ubigeo Data (Raw)

**Note: ** Some of the input data, like the antennas ones, is not attached to this repo for privacy reasons.
